# K-Means-Clustering
**Lloyd's algorithm for K-Means clustering**

The python file provides a simple implementation of Lloyd's algorithm for K-means clustering. It consist of two steps:

* Assignment step: Each observation in the data is assigned to the nearest cluster by use of the Euclidean distance from the point in the data to the cluster centroid.
* Update step: The mean of each cluster is calculated and assigned as the new centroid.
