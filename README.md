# K-Means-Clustering
**Lloyd's algorithm for K-Means clustering**

The python file provides a simple implementation of Lloyd's algorithm for K-means clustering. It consist of two steps:

* Assignment step: Each observation is the data is assign to the nearest clusters by use of the Euclidean distance
* Update step: The mean of each centroid is calculated and assigned to assigned as the corresponding centroid
